```

## make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
#adjust factors to be factors
bears$SEX<- as.factor(bears$SEX)
bears$MONTH<- as.factor(bears$MONTH)
```

## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

The bears neck is 20 inches around which helps predict about 57 inches in length. Looking at the accompanying data, it shows that the residual standard error is 5.376, and the R-squared is .7524. 


## Compare all models that predict LENGTH other than NECK. Then order them from worst to best by its value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better), or by RSE (residual standard error) where smaller is better.
